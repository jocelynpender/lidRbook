# Introduction

`lidR` is an R package for manipulating and visualizating airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with an emphasis on forestry applications. The package is entirely open source and is integrated within the geospatial R ecosytem (i.e. `raster`, `sp`, `sf`, `rgdal` etc.). This guide has been written to help both the ALS novice, as well as seasoned point cloud processing veterans. Key functionality of `lidR` includes functions to:

* Read and write `.las` and `.laz` files (section \@ref(read))
* Plot point clouds and customize visualizations (section \@ref(plot))
* Generate standard ALS outputs such as digital terrain models (DTM) (section \@ref(dtm)), digital surface models (DSM), and canopy height models (CHM) (section \@ref(chm))
* Process point clouds including point classification (section \@ref(gnd)), normalization (section \@ref(norm)), and filtering (section \@ref(filter))
* Compute standard and user-defined statistical metrics for forest modelling at different levels of regularisation (section \@ref(metrics))
* Guidelines for implementing area-based approaches to forest modelling using ALS data (section \@ref(modelling))
* Manage processing for sets of point cloud files - referred to as a `LAScatalog` (section \@ref(engine))
* Facilitate user-defined processing streams for research and development. (section \@ref(outbox))

The current release version of `lidR` can be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/) and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR).

Development of the `lidR` package between 2015 and 2018 was made possible thanks to the financial support of the AWARE project [NSERC CRDPJ 462973-14](https://aware.forestry.ubc.ca/); grantee [Prof. Nicholas C. Coops](https://profiles.forestry.ubc.ca/person/nicholas-coops/).

Development of the `lidR` package between 2018 and 2020 was made possible thanks to the financial support of the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs of Québec.

_This book was created to provide hands on descriptions and tutorials for using `lidR` and is **not** the formal package documentation. Find definitive package documentation [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/lidR.pdf)._
