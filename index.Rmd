# Introduction

`lidR` is an R package for manipulating and visualizating airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for forestry applications that is integrated within the geospatial R ecosytem (i.e. `raster`, `sp`, `sf`, `rgdal` and so on). This guide has been written to help both the LiDAR novice, as well as seasoned point cloud processing veterans. Key functionality of the package includes functions to:

* Read and write `.las` and `.laz` files
* Plot point clouds and customize visualization
* Generate standard ALS outputs such as digital terrain models (DTM), digital surface models (DSM), and canopy height models (CHM)
* Process point clouds including point classification, normalization, filtering & thinning
* Compute standard and user-defined statistical metrics for forest modelling at different level of regularisation
* Guidelines for implementing area-based approaches to forest modelling using ALS LiDAR data
* Manage processing for sets of point cloud files - referred to as a `LAScatalog`
* Facilitate user-defined processing streams for research and development.

The current release version of `lidR` can be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/) and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR). 

Development of the `lidR` package between 2015 and 2018 was made possible thanks to the financial support of the AWARE project [NSERC CRDPJ 462973-14](https://aware.forestry.ubc.ca/); grantee [Prof. Nicholas C. Coops](https://profiles.forestry.ubc.ca/person/nicholas-coops/).

Development of the `lidR` package between 2018 and 2020 was made possible thanks to the financial support of the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs of Québec.
