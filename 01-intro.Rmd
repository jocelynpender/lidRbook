## Reading lidar data {-#my-section}

The first step to working with lidar data in R is understanding how to read a file using the `lidR`package. We will be demonstrating using the `Megaplot.laz` example file that is included within `lidR` on installation, as well as how you would read a file on a local disc. To read a lidar file into a format that `lidR` understands, we use the `readLAS` function.

```{r}
#Define Megaplot.laz the file we want to read
LASfile <- system.file("extdata", "Megaplot.laz", package="lidR")

#Read LASfile
las <- readLAS(LASfile)
```

Once the file has been read (this should take just a second or two) we can query the contents of our newly loaded lidar file named `las` using the `print` function.

```{r}
print(las)
```
