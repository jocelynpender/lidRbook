**This is an alpha version of the book**

This is a book about the `lidR` package written with `bookdown`. This book contains illustrated tutorial and information about ALS data processing in R with the `lidR` package but *is not* the documentation. Instead it is a guide written to help both the ALS novice, as well as seasoned point-cloud processing veterans to understand the package.
